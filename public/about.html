<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 41 year old designer living in Madison, WI.  I love to run, ski, do taekwondo, build legos, and spend time
  with my family.  I'm interested in learning full stack web development in order to advance my career, be a 
  more effective public servant, and enjoy my fascination with technology.
</p>

<p>During the next few months I'll be taking the Web Development Boot Camp by Angela Yu to build fundamental skills
  I can use towards certifications in the Salesforce platform. Eventually I'd like to be a certified admin, certified
  UX designer, and certified JavaScript developer.
